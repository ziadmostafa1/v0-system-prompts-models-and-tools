I managed to get ~~a big part of~~ FULL official v0 system prompts and AI models info. Over 2.8k lines

# What do you want to see next? ---> Open an issue.

LATEST UPDATE: 06/03/2025

You can check it out in v0.txt, v0 model.txt and v0 tools.txt

~~And now the question is, what model is v0 using? soon. 👀~~ v0 AI MODELS INFO RELEASED! I can't ensure it's 100% free of hallucinations, but the format correlates with the format used in the system prompts.

The default model of v0 is GPT-4o, and for reasoning, it uses DeepSeek. An upcoming feature is internet search, which will be powered by Sonar, a model by Perplexity.
